# Melanoma-Detection-Assignment
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Data is used from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xLfSQUGDl8ezNNbUkpuHOYvSpTyxVhCs/view

## Conclusions
- Without Normalization and Augmentation, model is overfit with accuracy 96% and validation accuracy 26% (20 epochs).
- Class rebalance helped and overfitting was gone with accuracy 70% and validation accurray 44% (50 epochs).

## Technologies Used
- matplotlib - version 3.9.2 
- numpy - version 1.26.4
- pandas - version 2.2.3
- tensorflow - version 2.18.0
